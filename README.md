Project Showcase: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YR3J-YgD61dtNZ-olenBsbpqFnE9h1wc/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114252530653736808036&rtpof=true&sd=true

* **Purpose**: The purpose of the project is to create a top-down sandbox god simulator using Python with Pygame and familiarize myself with the game development process, procedural generation algorithms, and applying object oriented programming principles. 
* **Goal**: My minimum end goal by the end of June is to have a procedurally generated map with humans and 1 or 2 other creatures which can interact with each other. There should also be some effects which the player can use (such as bombs and lightning). 
* **Technology Used**: I will use the PyGame Python module with Python 3 to create the game.
